# FPGA Laboratory Repository
Repository to hold the VHDL files I wrote for EN.520.424

Lab 6 - Logic Analyzer

Lab 7 - Serial Converter
* Part A: RS-232
* Part B: SPI
* Part C: I2C

Lab 8 - Frequency Counter

Things to note: 
* The MATLAB GUI files as well as the VHDL GUI files were provided by the instructor to facilitate interface with the submission files.
